    "My first flat in London was located in Marylebone. I got lucky in many ways, one of them was that for my daily commute to Liverpool Street Station, I could choose between 4 different tube lines: Circle , Hammersmith & City, Bakerloo and Metropolitan. I quickly became baffled by how the number of people in the trains on different stations varied different day. Some days the Edware road station would be packed, while other days it was empty and the Bakerloo station would be packed at exactly the same time. \n",
